iservices.rssdocument: A dynamic RSS content-type for plone

This is a dynamic RSS content-type for plone. This idea comes from the
necessity to insert or embedd RSS content within Plone. This products
will provide a simple content-type which will display RSS feeds by using jQuery,
which is already available from Plone.

You will only need to add the RSS feed URL and configure how many items to
display. The jquery app will download the RSS fedd and show it inside plone.
